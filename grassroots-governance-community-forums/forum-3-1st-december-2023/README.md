## Opening session: What is "community"?

We presented [these slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17t2P\_XsC\_iv0FXncX8RqE2wBRBAizfNRI-SF-4aReRY/edit?usp=sharing), on our view of what "community" can be, and how to sustain it in times of no funding.

### COMMENTS FROM THE ROOM:

* The Catalyst community - those who are continuously not just proposing, but participating - is a bit <mark style="color:red;">**disillusioned**</mark>. I get this sense from those I see around me in this social ecosystem. When I listen to what others say, I feel like there’s not much of a Catalyst community any longer - it’s like <mark style="color:red;">**Catalyst has become a product now,**</mark> and doesn’t require a community.
* “Community” is finding people who have <mark style="color:red;">**similar purpose**</mark> & values.
* I don’t have a direct insight into Catalyst - I’m from sNET - but I do see all kinds of social initiatives  in Catalyst (like Swarm, Andamio, Gimbalabs) focusing on <mark style="color:red;">**the people**</mark>. That seems to be the heart of “community”.
* One of the things I value most about the community - maybe not all of us, but some - is <mark style="color:red;">**the diversity**</mark><mark style="color:red;">.</mark>
* “Community” in the “IRL” world is often geographically-based , but for us in Cardano it’s diverse and <mark style="color:red;">**global**</mark>.
* It’s still not very diverse on gender. <mark style="color:red;">**I wish there were more women.**</mark>
* In this community I find people who are passionate, generous with their knowledge, and trying to find ways to move forward together. Not so much as it used to be (increasingly, there’s power dynamics, economics, people who are here just for the money) but I think it still stands; the culture is mostly respectful of each other. <mark style="color:red;">**We hear each other.**</mark> That’s what makes me feel I belong.
