# Plenary session

### Key takeaways: Breakout Room 1

* INO is working on standards frameworks, defining structures.&#x20;
* Where is the impact happening in communities?
* Wide-ranging discussion - land ownership and DAOs; examples from history; novel company structures
* sNET's DAO - how it will be structured, how it is working - sybil attacks, privacy. Some insights on whether one DAO can provide legal certainty to another DAO if they are connected.
* Discussed bringing sNET ambassador program to Estonia
* Main thing to consider now is technology - the Internet gives us power, but how do you give access to people? Choose your use-cases. &#x20;

### Key takeaways: Breakout Room 2

* How CIP-1694 has been evolving, how Intersect came into the design, and its proposed structure and purpose;
* The 3 layers of Intersect, with the steering layer as the one that has community input;&#x20;
* The Civics Committee, and an overview of some key questions it is dealing with
* Committees have no decisionmaking power, only consultative
* Loads of work to do, so Intersect needs more people - tooling, growing networks
* But there are some real challenges around incentivisation and working for free
* Also challenges around truly decentralising and co-producing with the community
* The more people join Intersect who think in decentralised ways, the better. Identify spots where you can add value.

### **Q\&A**

**QUESTION:** Is it better to join Intersect as an organisation or an individual?\
**ANSWER:** It probably doesn’t make much difference. Some have joined twice, one of each. Most contributions are individuals at this point - though more and more companies have been joining. Also “guilds” have started to unofficially form - e.g. NFTs, DeFi. Eventually there will be a subscription cost - but people might be able to “pay” with work.

**QUESTION:** With the now well-known phrase of Charles’s “You pay or you work” - it will be interesting to see what the equivalency is. How much work will be required from a poorer person, to match the payment that a richer person makes?\
**ANSWER:** Yes, there have been conversations about that!

**COMMENT**:  I’m not participating in Cardano governance because frankly, I am sick of it. I am interested in these Internet Native Organisations.
