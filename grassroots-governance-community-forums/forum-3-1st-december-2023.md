# Forum 3: 1st December 2023

Join Governance Guild and other web3 community members on **December 1, 2023,  16h00-18h00 UTC** for another Grassroots Governance Community Forum!

### Event Details:

**Date:** 1st December 2023\
**Time:** 16:00 - 18:00 UTC\
**Where:** Live on Zoom. [Register here](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZwkde6vrTwtHdHIPHKRcOFZPjUebEJXcfhr)

### Session outline:

#### **Opening discussion:**&#x20;

_**What is "community", and can we sustain it in the absence of funding?**_\
followed by a choice of two breakout rooms:

#### **Breakout room 1:**&#x20;

_**Decentralised Treasury Management Models and Legal Requirements**_, facilitated by the [Internet Native Organization](https://internetnative.org/).&#x20;

Every community collaboration needs treasury management, but there are many challenges in managing decentralised treasuries and making them legally compliant and transparent for regulators and the community. Come and learn from individuals working to overcome these challenges!&#x20;

#### **Breakout room 2:**&#x20;

_**Community, Governance, and Intersect (the Cardano MBO)**_, facilitated by Governance Guild and José de Gamboa.&#x20;

Intersect is Cardano’s members-based organisation, but it’s unclear how community members interested in governance can get involved, organise, and help drive change. One possible mechanism is through Intersect’s Civics Committee. In this session, we’ll look at the Civics Committee - its composition, its role, and how to get involved - and we’ll discuss how we can build and maintain a sense of community within Intersect.

#### Plenary:

Feedback from the two brekout rooms, followed by a discussion and decisions on elegant next steps.
