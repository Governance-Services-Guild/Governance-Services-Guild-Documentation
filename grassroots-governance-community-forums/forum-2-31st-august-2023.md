We’ll be unpacking the question raised at the last forum on 15th July, “What is a DAO?” followed by a choice of three guest-led breakout rooms:

1. [**Photrek**](https://www.photrek.io/home) - _Sociocracy / Voting Methods_
2. [**SingularityNet**](https://singularitynet.io/): topic TBC
3. [**Wada**](https://www.wada.org/) - _dReps: A critique of representation based on traditional African paradigms_
