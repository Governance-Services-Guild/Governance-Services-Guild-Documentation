# What are the forums?

The Grassroots Community Governance Forums are a series of open forums run by Governence Guild.&#x20;

They take place roughly every 6 weeks, and engage governance activists from Project Catalyst and other web3 communities to explore the pressing issues in decentralised governance, and to discuss how to govern ourselves. \
\
By bringing people together to talk, listen, and learn, these forums aim to address the significant learning curve that we will all face as we plan our projects. We're maximising the wisdom of the crowd, and identifying community solutions to our shared problems.

If you'd like to attend a forum, see the Zoom signup link on the page for the date you'd like to attend.
